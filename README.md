OVERVIEW

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The existing Banasthali Vidyapith Web Application has a traditional user interface and has no functionality through which students can know about faculty 
and reach out to them at time of difficulty.

SOLUTION STATEMENT:

We have improved the user interface of existing institutional web application and added some useful functionalities such as faculty profile which can be 
updated by the respective faculty and can post articles, documents, images, research papers on their subject of interest which can be viewed by students 
and can reach out to them at the time of difficulty.
There is also student profile which will be accessed by the respective students in which they can view their general information and attendance of current 
semester.
Only the registered users that are students and faculty can view faculty profile whereas student profile can be viewed by the student itself only.

ABOUT:

This project is based on the educational institute system where this application gives maximum services at one place that is used by System Administration, Faculty, Students and Guest Users. It is user friendly application to interact, manage and access information about Banasthali Vidyapith.
The project focuses in building an application that will provide the information regarding Banasthali Vidyapith Institute. The admission openings, the fee structure, course structure, life at Banasthali and all the educational programs provided by the institute.
The features that can be used by the intended audience will be:
•Admin can access and control the whole application. Admin can add new updates about the University, modify the information of Banasthali University available on the application and delete any irrelevant or non- existing content.
•Faculty members can create their profile after registering through the institution id. They can add articles, research papers of their subject of interest by making a post or uploading files or documents, images on their profile. Faculty profiles would be visible to the students and faculty members and not to guest users.
•Students can register through their institution ID after which they can access the resources entity of the application and view their profile which will contain their general information, attendance of the current semester, leaves taken and the results of the previous semesters. Student profile will be visible to owned student and student’s guardians.
•Guest users can view the website.


CONSTRAINTS:

The constraints of the project are:

1)The resources will be accessed only by the registered users and will be updated by the Admin.  
2)The faculty profiles will not be visible to the guest users. 
3)Student profile will not be visible to anyone other than the student itself and their guardians.
4)The user should be connected to the internet. Since the application fetches data from the database over the internet.
